Clock Code- Write professional, well documented, and readable code.
What did you do particularly well?
I was able to make my flowchart follow the code build. Wich essentially produced the correct code. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? 
I still dont quite understand how to integrate my code. Although, this project didn't call for it, it focused on stright code. If I master this skill and technic then my coding skills will be closer to an experience coder. I think it defintitly will make more effincent at doing my jon=b when I
 graduate.
 
 Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
 Yes, at the end the code, when it runs and and my error was it was not able to display probably. However, it was a quick fix. I had to change the end of my code and make sure I had the proper symbols.
 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The organizational skill set definitely is going to be used in other projects. I will be using the direction use of a sequence of funtion and minimizes the main. I ad success with this code becuase it was simple. it was not asking for the code to read to diffrent application. I know that most applications cause for the intergertation to do diffrent funtions. But, I am not looking forward to it. I think when I follow my peuscode it shows in the process. When I double check the end of my code and symbols, I have suceess. I can honsetly say it was the smaller details that landing me successfully at the finish line.
