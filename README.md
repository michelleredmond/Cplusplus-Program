Clock Code- Write professional, well documented, and readable code.
What did you do particularly well?
I was able to make my flowchart follow the code build. Wich essentially produced the correct code. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? 
I still dont quite understand how to integrate my code. Although, this project didn't call for it, it focused on stright code. If I master this skill and technic then my coding skills will be closer to an experience coder. I think it defintitly will make more effincent at doing my jon=b when I
 graduate.
 
 Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
 Yes, at the end the code, when it runs and and my error was it was not able to display probably. However, it was a quick fix. I had to change the end of my code and make sure I had the proper symbols.
 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The organizational skill set definitely is going to be used in other projects. I will be using the direction use of a sequence of funtion and minimizes the main. I ad success with this code becuase it was simple. it was not asking for the code to read to diffrent application. I know that most applications cause for the intergertation to do diffrent funtions. But, I am not looking forward to it. I think when I follow my peuscode it shows in the process. When I double check the end of my code and symbols, I have suceess. I can honsetly say it was the smaller details that landing me successfully at the finish line.

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The Gaming Room client has a gaming application Draw It or Lose IT that was created for android systems. This game was designed to compete with teams about what is being drawn. The game also has four rounds one minute each and a pleather of clues. The client wants to expand the game application to multiple platforms and software. I think I gave particularly good evaluative information on the server side. I like the evaluation of platforms. Because each platform had their own section, it made it easier to complete. This separation gives you a individualized inquiry boxes related to that server. Then, the design constraints and domain model really help with the development of the code. As well as the UML diagram.  I would redo the information I provided for the client side because I provided some information that was not accurate. I would properly redo my UML diagram for structure proposes. It is important to remember client needs because we must make sure we are fulling the guidelines. I had to keep reading the document and then my work to insure I have filled the needs and wants of the client. I tried my best to implement the requirements. Doing this will ensure success of the project. I will use my UML diagram for the code because it lists the objectives and appropriate language use. I would continue to use the UML diagram, refer back to the design document, and continuing to refer to the client’s request.
